#Supermarket Pricing solution 

Supermarket Pricing solution based on [Code Kata](http://codekata.com/kata/kata01-supermarket-pricing/)

Below are some interesting scenarios from the kata

Some things in supermarkets have simple prices: this can of beans costs $0.65.

Other things have more complex prices. 

For example:

* three for a dollar (so whatâ€™s the price if I buy 4, or 5?)
* $1.99/pound (so what does 4 ounces cost?)
* buy two, get one free (so does the third item have a price?)

How would you model the shopping cart in the above scenarios ?

I found this interesting problem and started hacking out a possible implementation.
