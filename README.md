Shopping cart modelling solution based on Code Kata described @ http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/code_kata_one_s.html

Just to get you curious consider the below scenarios

Some things in supermarkets have simple prices: this can of beans costs $0.65.

Other things have more complex prices. For example:
three for a dollar (so whatâ€™s the price if I buy 4, or 5?)
$1.99/pound (so what does 4 ounces cost?)
buy two, get one free (so does the third item have a price?)

How would you model the shopping cart in the above scenarios ?

I found this interesting and so i set about developing a mini application with test cases.
